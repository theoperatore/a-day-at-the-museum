A day at the Museum
===================

I recently took a trip to the [Museum of the Moving Image](http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2016/03/25/detail/computer-films-of-the-1960s/) and came across a pretty hypnotic movie with had excerpts from 1960s computer graphics.

I figured I'd try my hand and [this](http://anpetersen.me/a-day-at-the-museum) is what I came up with.
